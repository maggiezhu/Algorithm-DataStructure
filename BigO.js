/*
    - Time Complexity 
      BigO      
      Object: 
        insert, removal, change = O(1)
        search for a value = O(n)
        .keys(),.values(),.entries() = O(n)
        .hasOwnProperty() = O(1) -> pass in a key and see if it exist


    - Space Complexity(auxiliary space complexity)
      recursion concerins with space complexity 
      most preimitive are constant space (booleans, number, undefined)
      String: O(n) space 
      Object: O(n) where n is the number of keys
